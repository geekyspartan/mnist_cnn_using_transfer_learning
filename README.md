# CNN on MNIST dataset Using Transfer Learning

Trained a CNN on digits 1,4,5,9 using convolutional, pooling, and softmax layers. Then used this trained model's weights to classify the remaining 6 digits i.e 0,2,3,6,7,8. Additional layers were added to improve the accuracy.

Model is tested on two different dataset:
Accuracy for 1459 dataset:   99.253%
Accuracy for 023678 network: 99.147%   

Also added code to check activations of convolutional layers, pooling layers, kernals for convolution layers, and the execution graph.
